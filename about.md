You look…perfect. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. You look…perfect. I'm really more an apartment person. You all right, Dexter?

I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm really more an apartment person. You all right, Dexter? Keep your mind limber. **Tonight's the night.** _And it's going to happen again and again._ It has to happen.

### Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You look…perfect. Keep your mind limber. I'm generally confused most of the time. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Tell him time is of the essence. You look…perfect. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

> Like a sloth. I can do that.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm really more an apartment person. He taught me a code. To survive. You're a killer. I catch killers.

You all right, Dexter? Cops, another community I'm not part of. I am not a killer. I am not a killer. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. God created pudding, and then he rested. He taught me a code. To survive. Like a sloth. I can do that.

I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Tell him time is of the essence. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. You're a killer. I catch killers. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.
