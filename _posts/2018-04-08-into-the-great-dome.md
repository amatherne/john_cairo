    What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" I hear the jury's still out on
    science. Well, what do you expect, mother? There's so many poorly chosen words
    in that sentence.

  detail: Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have
    more fun. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.
    It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I
    like being with you.

It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Marry me. I care deeply for nature. Michael! There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.

Across from where? Across from where? **He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.** _I'm afraid I just blue myself._ Marry me.

## That's why you always leave a note!

First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I care deeply for nature. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Michael! There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.

Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I'm a monster. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.
