I'm not a roman mum, I'm a kike, a yid, a heebie, a hook-nose, I'm kosher mum, I'm a Red Sea pedestrian, and proud of it! This morning, shortly after 11:00, comedy struck this little house on Dibley Road. Sudden, violent comedy.

Well, er, yes Mr. Anchovy, but you see your report here says that you are an extremely dull person.
