<h2>Where's that tool?</h2><p>I'm working on a concept to find and locate tools/parts within a mechanic shop. The data will be stored in Google Sheets and pulled in via AJAX. Users will be able to either go through a series of categories or simply search for keywords; with the items being displayed below as a grid of simple icons or photos with the item's name visable. In the pen below I've written out what one instance of an icon might look like!</p><p>Once they've located their item, they can click the icon to display more information. Including the item's: serial-code, in-stock/missing status, description of use/not use, and photo depiction of where it is located. Since it's made to be used quickly, the most pertinent information is displayed first. The item's location code is displayed but the photo location is hidden unless needed. Same for the descriptive information.</p><p>See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/Pnkdrmmr/pen/bwXdNp/">bwXdNp</a> by Austin Matherne (<a href="http://codepen.io/Pnkdrmmr">@Pnkdrmmr</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>
